# **MERN Stack Portfolio**

### A full-stack, responsive portfolio website to showcase my skills and projects, built with the MERN stack.

This project is a dynamic, full-stack portfolio designed to highlight my work as a developer. Unlike a static site, this application uses a MongoDB database to manage and serve project and contact information, making it easy to update without touching the code.


## **‚ú®Features**

* **Full-Stack Architecture:** Separated frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express) for a modular and scalable application.
* **Dynamic Content:** Project details and other information are stored in a MongoDB database, allowing for easy updates.
* **RESTful API:** A well-structured API serves data from the database to the React frontend.
* **Responsive Design:** A clean, modern UI that adapts to various screen sizes.
* **Contact Form:** Submissions are handled by the backend and saved to the database.

## **Project Structure**
The project is divided into two main directories:

- **Server:** Contains the server-side code, including API routes, models, controllers, and configuration files.‚Äã

- **Client:** Contains the client-side code built with React.js, including components, contexts, and pages.




## üöÄTech Stack

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
* **React Router:** For navigation and routing within the single-page application.
* **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API calls.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For a utility-first approach to styling and responsive design.

**Backend**

* **Node.js & Express.js:** The server environment and framework for handling requests.
* **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing data.
* **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
* **CORS:** A Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
